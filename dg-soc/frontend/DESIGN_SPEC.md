# DeceptionGraph SOC — Frontend Design Spec

Owner: M1 (Pashmee). Covers design tokens, the app shell, global states, the wording
dictionary and all seven screens.

This is the design source of truth for `frontend/`. Data shapes come from
`contracts/API.md`, `contracts/event.schema.json` and `contracts/finding.schema.json`.
Wording comes from `AGENTS.md` section 7. Thresholds and weights come from
`config/scoring.yaml` — **never hardcode them in the UI**, read them off the API response.

---

## 0. The three laws

Every decision below follows from these. If a design choice conflicts with one, the law wins.

1. **The browser never decides anything.** Score, severity, link status, whether a block
   worked — all of it arrives from the API and is displayed as received. No arithmetic on
   scores, no inferring severity from a number, no optimistic "blocked!" state.
2. **Attacker text is hostile.** Usernames, commands, paths and query strings are controlled
   by the attacker and land on our screen. Always render as plain React children. **Never**
   `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Attacker-controlled strings always render in the mono font
   inside a bounded container so they cannot break layout.
3. **Claim only what the evidence proves.** Every finding shows its `limitation` next to its
   `label`, at the same visual weight. Section 3 is the allowed wording list.

---

## 1. Screen inventory

The M1 prompt lists seven deliverables, but mixes screens with components. Here is the
actual route map. Seven screens, with the kill-chain bar and noise counter as components
that live inside them.

| # | Screen | Route | Primary data |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Overview | `/` | `GET /api/stats/overview`, `GET /api/health` |
| 2 | Live Feed | `/events` | `GET /api/events` + `/ws/events` |
| 3 | Incident List | `/incidents` | `GET /api/incidents` |
| 4 | Incident Detail | `/incidents/:id` | `GET /api/incidents/{id}` |
| 5 | Transcript Replay | `/incidents/:id/transcript/:sessionId` | `GET /api/incidents/{id}/transcript` |
| 6 | Attack Graph | `/graph` | `GET /api/links`, `GET /api/incidents` |
| 7 | Response Center | `/response` | `GET /api/response/actions` |

The **kill-chain bar** is a component on screens 3 (compact) and 4 (full).
The **noise counter** is a component on screen 1.
The **block flow** is a modal sequence launched from screens 4 and 7.

Build order (matches the H4/H8/H12 gates): **2 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 5 → 6 → 7.**
Screen 2 is the H4 gate, so it ships first. Screen 7 is last because the block flow depends
on M2's response router existing.

---

## 2. Design tokens

Dark theme only. The demo runs on a laptop in a lit room, often mirrored to a projector, so
contrast targets are deliberately conservative: body text ≥ 7:1, secondary ≥ 4.5:1.
No mobile layout. Design to a 1440×900 canvas, degrade gracefully to 1280×800.

### 2.1 Colour — surfaces and text

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg-base` | `#0B0F14` | Page background |
| `--bg-surface` | `#111822` | Cards, panels, table bodies |
| `--bg-raised` | `#1A232F` | Modals, dropdowns, hover rows, table headers |
| `--bg-inset` | `#080C11` | Terminal, code blocks, scrollable wells |
| `--border` | `#243040` | Default 1px borders, table row dividers |
| `--border-strong` | `#33465C` | Focused inputs, active cards, modal edge |
| `--text-primary` | `#E6EDF3` | Headings, values, body |
| `--text-secondary` | `#9BA9B7` | Labels, column headers, metadata |
| `--text-muted` | `#6B7A8A` | Disabled, "not observed", placeholders |
| `--accent` | `#3DA9FC` | Links, buttons, focus ring, selected state |
| `--accent-weak` | `rgba(61,169,252,0.12)` | Selected row tint, accent button hover |

### 2.2 Colour — severity

Severity comes from the API (`severity` field). The thresholds in `config/scoring.yaml`
(low 0, medium 25, high 50, critical 80) are documented here **for reference only** — the UI
reads the string, it does not compute it from the score.

| Severity | Base | Fill (12%) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `low` | `#4A90A4` | `rgba(74,144,164,0.12)` | Probing, little progress |
| `medium` | `#D99A2B` | `rgba(217,154,43,0.12)` | Real attempt underway |
| `high` | `#E0703B` | `rgba(224,112,59,0.12)` | Got in, or exploit attempted |
| `critical` | `#D9394B` | `rgba(217,57,75,0.12)` | Data served, or confirmed cross-decoy path |

**Badge style — outlined, not solid.** 1px border in the base colour, 12% fill, text in the
base colour lightened to pass contrast. Solid fills with dark text fail at projector gamma.

```
┌──────────┐
│ CRITICAL │   border #D9394B · fill rgba(217,57,75,.12) · text #FF8A96
└──────────┘   11px, 600, letter-spacing .06em, uppercase, radius 4px, padding 2px 8px
```

Severity is **never** encoded by colour alone — the badge always carries the word. Colour
blindness, and projectors that shift hue.

### 2.3 Colour — status and semantics

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--ok` | `#3DD68C` | Connection live, sensor healthy, action verified, link confirmed |
| `--warn` | `#D99A2B` | Reconnecting, sensor stale, preview expiring |
| `--danger` | `#D9394B` | Offline, blocked request, reject action |
| `--pending` | `#A78BFA` | Awaiting analyst decision, `pending_confirmation` findings |
| `--neutral` | `#6B7A8A` | Not observed, expired, revoked, uncounted |

`--pending` is intentionally a different hue from every severity colour. "This needs a human"
must never read as "this is severe".

### 2.4 Typography

Two faces. One rule decides which: **anything the machine produced is mono.**

**System stacks only — no webfonts.** Laptop B has no internet on the lab link
(`AGENTS.md` §6), so a Google Fonts request would hang and then silently fall back
mid-demo. JetBrains Mono is listed first in the mono stack so it gets used where it happens
to be installed locally, but nothing depends on it.

| Face | Stack | Use |
|---|---|---|
| UI | `system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif` | Headings, labels, prose, buttons |
| Mono | `"JetBrains Mono", ui-monospace, "SF Mono", Menlo, Consolas, monospace` | IPs, all IDs, timestamps, commands, paths, query strings, hashes, rule codes, ATT&CK codes |

The mono rule matters for credibility: when every `evt_...` and every attacker command is
visibly machine data, judges can see at a glance what came from the system versus what we
wrote.

| Role | Size / line-height / weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Page title | 24 / 32 / 600 | One per screen |
| Section heading | 16 / 24 / 600 | Card headers |
| Body | 14 / 20 / 400 | |
| Label | 12 / 16 / 500 | `--text-secondary`, uppercase, `.04em` tracking |
| Micro | 11 / 14 / 500 | Badges, pills, table metadata |
| Mono data | 13 / 20 / 400 | Inline IDs, IPs, timestamps |
| Mono terminal | 13 / 22 / 400 | Transcript replay only |
| Metric | 32 / 36 / 600 | Overview counters, incident score |

### 2.5 Spacing, radius, elevation

4px base. Use only: **4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48**.

- Card padding `16px`; modal padding `24px`; table cell padding `8px 12px`
- Gap between cards `16px`; between page sections `24px`
- Radius: controls and badges `4px`, cards `8px`, modals `12px`, pills `999px`
- One shadow only, for modals: `0 16px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`. Cards use borders, not shadows.

### 2.6 Focus and motion

- Focus ring on every interactive element: `2px solid var(--accent)`, `2px` offset. Never
  remove outlines — the block flow gets operated under demo pressure and keyboard focus
  must be obvious.
- Motion is functional only: `120ms ease-out` for hover and state changes, `200ms` for modal
  entry. New rows in the live feed get a one-shot 400ms accent-left-border flash, then settle.
  No sliding, no bouncing, no spinners that outlive their request.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — drop the flash to an instant background tint.

## 3. Wording dictionary

`AGENTS.md` section 7 is a hard constraint, not a style preference. These strings are the
only approved phrasings. Put them in one `src/copy.ts` module so nothing drifts.

| Context | Use exactly | Never |
|---|---|---|
| SSH commands | "command submitted to emulated shell" | "executed", "ran on the host" |
| File download | "synthetic file served" | "data exfiltrated", "data stolen" |
| Web attack match | "web attack attempt" | "exploited", "vulnerability exploited" |
| Open link | "candidate link" | "same attacker", "confirmed" |
| Token reuse, pre-confirm | "strong candidate link — honeytoken reuse" | "identified", "proven" |
| Confirmed link | "analyst-confirmed link" | "same person", "attributed" |
| Successful SSH auth | "accepted by emulated shell" | "compromised", "breached" |
| Block applied | "block applied — web decoy only" | "attacker isolated", "contained", "neutralised" |
| Block verified | "verified by blocked request `evt_...`" | "attack stopped" |
| Unreached stage | "not observed" | "safe", "clear", "none" |

Every finding card renders `label` **and** `limitation`. The limitation is `--text-secondary`
at body size — smaller than the label but not a footnote. It is a feature, not a disclaimer.

Severity words are lowercase in prose ("this incident is high severity") and uppercase only
inside badges.

### 4.1 Topbar — persistent, every screen

Left to right:

1. **Product name** — 14/600, `--text-primary`.
2. **Capture mode chip** — `LIVE` or `REPLAY`. Driven by the `capture_mode` on incoming
   events. `LIVE` is `--ok` outlined; `REPLAY` is `--pending` outlined. **Required on every
   screen** (PRD §8). If any event in view has `capture_mode: "replay"`, the chip reads
   `REPLAY`. If fixtures are on (`VITE_USE_FIXTURES=1`), the chip reads `FIXTURES` in
   `--warn` — so it is impossible to demo fixture data by accident.
   With no events received at all there is no capture to describe, so the chip reads
   `NO DATA` in neutral — never `LIVE`, which would be a claim we cannot back.
3. **`lab_run_id`** — mono, `--text-secondary`. Proves which run is on screen.
4. **Connection pill** — see 4.3.
5. **UTC clock** — mono, ticking. All timestamps in this app are UTC; the clock makes that
   obvious without a tooltip on every row.

### 4.2 Sidebar

Nav items with live counts fed by the WebSocket: Live Feed shows new-since-last-visit,
Incidents shows open incident count, Response shows currently applied actions. Active item
gets `--accent-weak` fill and a 2px `--accent` left border.

Below a divider, **sensor health** from `GET /api/health`: one row per sensor with a dot and
the relative time of its last event.

| Dot | Condition |
|---|---|
| `--ok` | Last event < 60s ago |
| `--warn` | 60s–5min ago — label "stale" |
| `--neutral` | `null` — label "no events yet" |
| `--danger` | `/api/health` unreachable |

This strip is the cheapest insurance in the build. When the demo misbehaves, it tells you
instantly whether the problem is the decoy, the backend or your UI.

### 4.3 Connection pill — the one piece of state that must never lie

| State | Dot | Label | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Live | `--ok`, soft 2s pulse | `live` | WebSocket open |
| Reconnecting | `--warn`, blinking | `reconnecting · attempt N` | Socket closed, retrying |
| Offline | `--danger`, static | `offline — showing data from 12:03:58Z` | Retries exhausted |

Reconnect uses exponential backoff with jitter: 500ms, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, then every 8s.

**On reconnect, reload the whole REST snapshot and discard the in-memory list** (`API.md`,
and PRD AC11). That means `GET /api/events` for the feed **plus** `GET /api/incidents` and
`GET /api/links` — every screen holding its own data resyncs, not just the feed. Do not try
to patch the gap from buffered messages. Clicking the pill when offline forces a retry
immediately.

**The `seq` gate applies to `event` messages only** (`API.md`, WebSocket section, contract
update `cc12ddd`). A `finding`, `link` or `incident` message carries the *newest event's*
seq at send time, so it usually repeats the seq before it — and an analyst decision emits
messages with no new event at all. Dropping those three types by seq would silently discard
exactly the updates the confirm button exists to produce. Apply them always, replacing the
item with the matching ID. `next_seq` from the snapshot is your last event seq; use it
rather than deriving a max from the page.

| `type` | Apply when | How |
|---|---|---|
| `event` | `seq` > last event seq | append to the feed |
| `finding` | always | replace by `finding_id` |
| `link` | always | replace by `link_id` |
| `incident` | always | replace by `incident_id`; if that incident's page is open, re-fetch it |
| `action` | reserved, not sent yet | poll `GET /api/response/actions` |

On the incident page, re-fetch rather than patching items in place: a rejected link removes
its R05 finding and no delete message is sent, so a patched page would keep showing a
finding the backend no longer has.

---

## 5. Global states

Every screen implements all six. Judges open empty screens; a half-built empty state reads
as a broken app.

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Loading (first)** | Skeleton rows matching final layout — grey `--bg-raised` blocks, subtle shimmer. Never a centred spinner; layout must not jump. |
| **Loading (refresh)** | Keep current data, 2px `--accent` indeterminate bar under the topbar. |
| **Empty** | Centred in the card: one line of what will appear, one line of how to make it appear. "No events yet. Events appear here as soon as a decoy is touched." Never just "No data". |
| **Error** | Inline card, `--danger` left border, the API's `error.code` in mono, `error.message` as prose, and a Retry button. Never a raw stack trace, never a toast that disappears. |
| **Stale** | Data older than 60s with no live socket: `--warn` banner at the top of the card, "Showing data from 12:03:58Z — not live". |
| **Degraded** | One widget's request failed but the screen is otherwise fine: that widget alone shows the error card. Never blank the whole screen for one failed call. |

---

## 6. Screen 1 — Overview

**Route** `/` · **Data** `GET /api/stats/overview`, `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/incidents`

The screen that is on display before the demo starts and after it ends. It has one job:
make the noise-reduction argument visible in a single glance.

```

**Noise counter** — three metrics at 32px, the exact sentence
`N raw events → M incidents, K low priority` beneath, then the bar. The bar is proportional
and purely decorative reinforcement; the numbers are the truth. `low_priority_incidents`
means incidents scoring below `low_priority_below` (25). Tooltip on "low priority":
*"Scored below the noise threshold set in scoring.yaml."*

**Time to first alert** — `first_alert_seconds`, one decimal, "s" in `--text-secondary`.
If `null`, show `—` with "no findings yet". Do not show `0.0`.

**Findings by rule** — horizontal bars from `findings_by_rule`. Rule code in mono, count at
the end. Fixed order R01, R02, R03, R04, R05, R07, R08, R09. **There is no R06** — do not
render a slot for it. Rules with zero count render a dim empty track, so the set of possible
rules is always visible. Clicking a bar goes to `/incidents` filtered by that rule.

**Active incidents** — compact rows: IP (mono), severity badge, score, and the compact
kill-chain strip. Whole row navigates to the incident.

## 7. Screen 2 — Live Feed · the H4 gate

**Route** `/events` · **Data** `GET /api/events?limit=200` then `/ws/events`

This is the first screen to exist and the one that passes G2 at H4: a real SSH event from
Kali, visible, with its event ID. Design it so a single event looks *intentional*, not like
an empty table with one row in it.

```

### 7.1 Behaviour

- **Newest on top.** Prepend on WebSocket `type: "event"`.
- **New-row flash**: 400ms `--accent` left border, then fade to the row's normal state.
- **Pause button.** Essential. During the demo rows arrive faster than anyone can read, and
  while paused you can actually point at one. Paused shows a `--warn` pill
  `paused · N new` and a Resume button. Pausing only freezes rendering; the buffer keeps
  filling and flushes on resume.
- **Cap the DOM at 500 rows.** Trim the oldest. Footer: "showing newest 500 of 1,284".
- **Filters** by sensor, event type and src_ip substring. Client-side over the loaded
  window, and the active filter is stated above the table so nobody misreads a filtered
  view as the whole truth.
- **Row click** opens the raw event drawer (7.4).

### 7.2 Event type presentation

Each of the eight `event_type` values gets a glyph and a colour. Glyph plus text label
always — never colour alone.

| `event_type` | Glyph | Colour | Label shown |
|---|---|---|---|
| `connection_open` | `○` | `--text-secondary` | connection open |
| `auth_failure` | `✕` | `--warn` | auth failure |
| `auth_success` | `✓` | `--danger` | auth accepted |
| `command_input` | `▸` | `--accent` | command submitted |
| `connection_close` | `●` | `--text-muted` | connection close |
| `http_request` | `◆` | `--accent` | http request |
| `synthetic_file_access` | `◆` | `--danger` | synthetic file access |
| `blocked_request` | `⊘` | `--ok` | blocked request |

Two deliberate inversions, worth being able to explain:

- `auth_success` is **red**, not green. A successful login to a decoy is the bad news.
- `blocked_request` is **green**. It means our block is working.

### 7.3 The detail column

One or two lines, derived from `attributes`, all in mono, truncated with ellipsis and the
full value in the drawer:

- `auth_failure` / `auth_success` → `username=dg_demo`
- `command_input` → the command, max 60 chars
- `http_request` → `METHOD path` then `query_redacted`, max 60 chars
- `synthetic_file_access` → `asset_id` then `size_bytes` and `outcome`
- `blocked_request` → `status 403 · act_01`

Beneath, always: `event_id` and, if present, `incident_id` as a link. Those IDs are how the
H4 gate is demonstrated — they are not decoration.

**Never render `password_sha256` or `sha256` in a row.** Hashes go in the drawer only,
truncated to 12 chars with a copy button.

### 7.4 Raw event drawer

Right-side panel, 480px, slides in 200ms. Header: event type, sensor, UTC timestamp,
`event_id` with copy button. Body: a two-column key/value table of every schema field,
then `attributes` expanded. Footer links: "view incident", "view transcript" when
`session_id` is present.

Attacker-controlled values (`command`, `path`, `query_redacted`, `user_agent`, `username`)
render in a `--bg-inset` well with `white-space: pre-wrap; overflow-wrap: anywhere` and a
max height of 160px. Bounded, scrollable, never breaking layout no matter what gets sent.

```

Cards, not a dense table — there will only ever be one to three incidents in this lab, and
cards let the kill-chain strip breathe. Scanning those silhouettes down the page is the
point: how far each source got, side by side.

Each card: 4px left border in the severity colour, severity badge, score at 20/600, src_ip
in mono at 16px, event count, the compact kill-chain strip, then a mono metadata line.
The whole card is the link into the incident.

Sort newest `last_seen` first. An incident updated by a WebSocket `type: "incident"` message
replaces the one on screen and gets a 1.2s `--accent` flash.

**No rule chips and no "awaiting decision" flag, by necessity.** `IncidentSummary` carries
no findings, and `Link` carries no `incident_id`, so neither has an honest source at this
endpoint. The alternatives were N+1 fetching every incident's detail or inventing the data;
both are worse than a slightly thinner card. Open question 2 asks Rohan for
`findings_by_rule` and `open_link_count` on `IncidentSummary` — if they arrive, add the
chips back as mono micro text in `--bg-raised`, with uncounted rules at 60% opacity and a
dashed border, plus an `--pending` flag for open links.

The compact strip uses the identical five-column grid as the full bar (§9.2) so silhouettes
stay comparable between cards and against the incident page.

### 9.1 Header

`src_ip` as the page title in mono at 24px — the IP is the subject of this page, not the
incident ID. Beneath it, a metadata line: `incident_id`, `lab_run_id`, event count,
first → last seen, duration.

Right side: the score at 32/600 in the severity colour, with the severity badge above it.

**Built as the bare number, not `100 / 100`.** The denominator would have to be the cap from
`config/scoring.yaml`, which the API does not expose — hardcoding `100` means the UI starts
lying the day M3 changes it. The cap still gets shown where it actually does something, in
the breakdown footer (§9.3). Open question 7 asks Rohan to expose `score_cap`; if he does,
restore the denominator.

Buttons: **Export** (`GET /api/incidents/{id}/export`, downloads; tooltip "JSON export,
password hashes excluded") and **Block** (opens the block flow, §12).

### 9.2 Kill-chain bar

Five fixed segments in fixed order: `recon`, `credential_attack`, `exploit_attempt`,
`post_access`, `data_access`. Always all five, always this order — the shape of the bar is
the at-a-glance read, so it must not reflow.

Observed (stage present in `stages_observed`): filled with the incident's severity colour,
the stage name in `--text-primary`, and the rule codes that evidence it beneath.

Unobserved: `--bg-raised` fill, 1px dashed `--border`, name in `--text-muted`, and the
literal words **"not observed"** where the rule codes would be. Not "safe", not "clear".

Derive the rule codes per stage by grouping `findings` on their `stage`. Findings with
`stage: "none"` (R05, R09) belong to no segment — they appear in the links panel instead.

Clicking a segment filters the findings list to that stage.

### 9.3 Score breakdown

Straight from `score_breakdown`: `rule_id`, `points`, `counted` and `reason`. Counted rows
show `✓` in `--ok` and the reason in `--text-secondary`. Uncounted rows render at 60%
opacity with `—` and their reason ("R01 already counted", "awaiting link confirmation").

Footer line: when the summed points exceed 100, show `raw 130 · capped at 100 → 100`. If
they do not exceed it, just show the total. Showing the cap doing its job is a credibility
detail — it proves the score is bounded by design.

**Do not sum the points yourself to produce the score.** Display the API's `score`. The raw
sum is shown only as a transparency aid next to the cap note, labelled `raw`.

### 9.4 Finding cards

Header row: `rule_id` (mono, bold), `stage` chip, `technique_ids` as mono chips linking to
`https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/001/` (new tab, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`),
and for R07 the `web_attack_class` values as `--warn` chips (`sqli`, `xss`, `lfi`, `rfi`,
`cmd_injection`).

Body: `label` at 14/500 `--text-primary`, then `limitation` at 14/400 `--text-secondary`
prefixed with a small `ⓘ`. The limitation is **always visible** — never behind a tooltip or
an accordion.

Footer: `evidence_event_ids` as mono chips. Each one is a button that opens that raw event
in the drawer from §7.4. Show the first three, then `+N` to expand. **Every evidence ID is
clickable** — this is the "evidence-linked" claim in the project's one-line pitch, and a
judge will click one.

Right-aligned: `points`. When `pending_confirmation` is true, show `0 pts`, an `--pending`
`⚑ pending` chip in the header, a 1px dashed `--pending` left border, and
"Awaiting analyst confirmation." as the limitation line.

### 9.5 Links panel

One row per link: `from_sensor ⇢ to_sensor`, the status phrase from the wording dictionary,
the `basis` in mono, and for decided links the `rationale` in quotes with `decided_at`.

| `status` | `kind` | Border | Phrase |
|---|---|---|---|
| `open` | `candidate` | 1px dashed `--pending` | candidate link |
| `open` | `strong_candidate` | 2px dashed `--pending` | strong candidate link — honeytoken reuse |
| `confirmed` | any | 2px solid `--ok` | analyst-confirmed link |
| `rejected` | any | 1px solid `--neutral`, 60% opacity | link rejected by analyst |

Open links get **Confirm** and **Reject** buttons, which open the decision modal (§11.1).
This mirrors the graph edge styling exactly, so the two screens teach each other.

### 9.6 Summary panel

`summary.text` as prose. A source chip: `[rules]` in `--neutral`, or `[llm]` in `--pending`
if an LLM summary is ever added. Beneath, `cited_event_ids` as clickable mono chips.

If `summary.source` is not `"rules"`, prepend the banner "Generated text — all claims cite
the event IDs below." The rule-based summary is the default and needs no such caveat.

### 9.7 Sessions panel

One row per session: `session_id` (mono), `sensor_id`, `started_at`, command count. Rows
with `commands > 0` get a `▸ Replay` button to screen 5. Rows with zero commands are dimmed
and not clickable — brute-force attempts never opened a shell, so there is nothing to replay.

### 9.8 Response panel

Mirrors `active_block`. When `null`: "no action applied" plus the **Preview block** button.
When present: the action card from §13.2 inline, with its status pill and countdown.

**The banner is mandatory and non-dismissible.** It is the single most important honesty
statement in the UI, and it sits above the content, not below it.

Terminal styling: `--bg-inset`, mono 13/22, generous row padding. It should feel like a
terminal without pretending to be a live one.

Line kinds from the API (`login_failed`, `login_ok`, `command`, `close`) reuse the glyphs
and colours from §7.2. `command` lines render a dim `--text-muted` prompt prefix before the mono `text` — it reads
as a shell session while keeping the attacker's text visually separate from our chrome.
Never interpret or syntax-highlight the command. Render the string as-is.

**The prompt is `<user>@ssh-decoy-01:~$`, built from the `login_ok` line's username and the
real sensor id** — not an invented hostname like `srv-01`. The host genuinely is the decoy,
so there is no reason to make one up, and a fabricated hostname on screen is the kind of
small fiction that costs credibility when a judge looks closely. With no accepted login in
the session, the prefix falls back to a bare `$`.

Every line shows its UTC timestamp (left, `--text-secondary`) and its `event_id` (right,
clickable to the drawer).

**Replay controls** — this is a *stepper*, not a video:

- Lines after the current step are hidden, not greyed. The reveal is the point.
- Current line gets a 2px `--accent` left bar.
- `▶ Play` auto-advances using the real gaps between `occurred_at` values, clamped to
  400ms–2s per step so the demo never stalls on a long pause. Speed selector 0.5× / 1× / 2×.
- Keyboard: `←` `→` step, `Space` play/pause, `Home` `End` jump. Judges hand the laptop back
  and forth; keyboard control reads as competence.
- Default state on open: **fully revealed, paused at the end.** Someone arriving from a
  finding's evidence link wants to see everything. The stepper is opt-in via `⏮`.

If `lines` is empty: "No commands recorded for this session." plus a note that brute-force
sessions never reached a shell.

**No graph library — inline SVG.** The layout here is fixed and deterministic by design, so
React Flow's layout engine, pan/zoom and edge routing would all go unused: roughly 50KB
gzipped for a static diagram. `prompts/M1_frontend.md` says "keep libraries minimal", and
zero libraries serves that better than one. Hand-rolled SVG also gives exact control over
the confirm animation, which is the demo's visual climax. Revisit only if the graph ever
needs real layout — with at most a handful of lab source IPs, it will not.

Layout is **fixed, not force-directed**: attacker nodes down the left, `ssh-decoy-01` upper
right, `web-decoy-01` lower right. Deterministic positions. A physics simulation that
jiggles under a projector helps nobody, and it must look identical in every rehearsal.

**No pan or zoom.** The SVG is responsive and always fits its container, growing downward as
sources are added, so there is nothing to pan to. Dropping it removes a control nobody would
touch and a way to get lost mid-demo.

**Edges are evidence, not inference.** A traffic edge is drawn only when the API confirms
that source was seen on that sensor, asked precisely as
`GET /api/events?incident_id=&sensor_id=&limit=1` per pair rather than inferred from a
capped page. Topology is a claim like any other.

Known limitation: `Link` has no `incident_id` (open question 2), so with two or more source
IPs each holding links, the decoy-to-decoy edges cannot be attributed to a particular
source. With the single source of the P3 demo it is unambiguous. Adding `incident_id` to
`Link` would fix it.

### 11.1 Nodes

**Attacker node** — `src_ip` in mono 16px, severity badge, score, event count. 2px border in
the severity colour. One per incident in view.

**Sensor nodes** — `sensor_id` in mono, a human label ("SSH decoy" / "Web decoy"), event
count from this source, and a health dot matching the sidebar. `--bg-raised`, 1px
`--border`.

Clicking an attacker node goes to its incident. Clicking a sensor node goes to the live feed
filtered by that sensor.

### 11.2 Edges — the thing judges look at

| Meaning | Style | Label |
|---|---|---|
| Observed traffic (IP → sensor) | 1px solid `--text-muted` | event count |
| `candidate` link | 2px dashed `--pending` | "candidate" |
| `strong_candidate` link | 3px dashed `--pending` | "candidate · tok_portal_01" |
| `confirmed` link | 3px solid `--ok` | "confirmed" |
| `rejected` link | 1px solid `--neutral`, 40% opacity | "rejected" |

The dashed → solid transition on confirm is the visual climax of the demo. Animate it over
400ms (dash offset to zero, colour `--pending` → `--ok`, with a brief outer glow), and
respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by switching instantly.

Honeytoken edges carry the `honeytoken_id` in the label, because "they reused our planted
credential" is the strongest claim the system makes and it should be legible without a click.

A persistent legend sits bottom-left. Judges should not have to ask what dashed means.

### 11.3 Link decision modal

Clicking an **open** edge opens it:

- `POST /api/links/{link_id}/decision` with `{decision, rationale}`.
- Both buttons disabled until the rationale reaches 5 characters, with a live counter.
  Enforce the minimum in the UI so the analyst never meets a server-side rejection mid-demo.
- Show both evidence events inline with their IDs and a one-line detail. The analyst is
  making a judgement call; the judgement needs its evidence on the same surface.
- The consequence sentence names **which rules** confirming makes count, without point
  values: a pending rule's `score_breakdown` row reports `points: 0`, so the UI has no
  honest source for "+15" and will not invent one. Open question 8 asks whether pending rows
  can carry their would-be points; until then the analyst sees the real delta when the score
  updates. Phrase it as a consequence, not a recommendation — the UI must not nudge toward
  confirming.
- The closing caveat is mandatory, straight from `demo_p3.md`.
- A decision is reversible: a decided link reopens this modal pre-filled with the previous
  rationale, and the primary button reads "Change decision".
- While in flight, buttons show a spinner and disable. On success, close and let the
  WebSocket `type: "link"` message drive the edge update — **do not** optimistically restyle
  the edge. Law 1.

```

Active actions (`applied`, `verified`) on top as full cards; terminal ones (`expired`,
`revoked`) in a compact history table.

### 12.1 Status pills — the honesty-critical bit

| `status` | Pill | Label | Means |
|---|---|---|---|
| `applied` | `--warn` outlined | `APPLIED` | Block written. **Not yet proven to work.** |
| `verified` | `--ok` solid-ish | `VERIFIED` | A `blocked_request` event arrived with this `block_action_id`. |
| `expired` | `--neutral` | `EXPIRED` | TTL ran out. |
| `revoked` | `--neutral` | `REVOKED` | Analyst undid it. |

**`VERIFIED` appears only when the API says `verified`.** Never infer it, never show it
optimistically, never show it because the request succeeded. The distinction between "we
wrote a blocklist entry" and "we observed the block rejecting a request" is exactly the kind
of rigour this project is being judged on. The verified card shows
`verified by evt_4d5e` as a clickable chip so the claim is checkable.

The countdown is computed from `until` against the client clock — the only exception to
"no computation in the browser", and it is cosmetic. When it hits zero, **re-fetch**; do not
flip the status to expired yourself.

Progress bar: `--ok` while over 30s remaining, `--warn` under 30s.

---

## 13. The block flow

Launched from the incident detail Block button or the Response Center. Three steps, and the
friction is deliberate — a one-click block is a liability, not a feature.

### 13.1 Step 1 — Preview

`POST /api/response/preview` with `{incident_id, ttl_seconds: 120}`.

```
┌─ Preview block ────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                        │
│ target        192.168.77.10                            │
│ scope         web-decoy-01 only                        │
│ duration      120 s                                    │
│ preview       pre_7a3f · expires in 0:52               │
│                                                        │
│ ⚠ This blocks the web decoy only. The SSH decoy stays  │
│   reachable. This does not isolate the host.           │
│                                                        │
│                      [ Cancel ]  [ Continue ]          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every value is read from the preview **response**, not from what we sent. If the backend
returns a different target or scope than expected, we show the backend's version.

The 60s preview expiry runs as a live countdown. On expiry the modal disables Continue and
offers "Preview expired — request a new one". Under 15s the countdown turns `--warn`.

A 400 (target not an allowed lab IP) renders the error inline with the API's
`error.message` and no Continue button. This path exists because `AGENTS.md` §6 forbids
blocking `192.168.77.20`, `127.0.0.1` or any range — and demonstrating that the guard rail
*works* is worth more than hiding it.

### 13.2 Step 2 — Approve

`POST /api/response/apply` with `{preview_id, reason, confirm: true}`.

```
┌─ Approve block ────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 192.168.77.10 · web-decoy-01 only · 120 s              │

│ └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│ Recorded in the action history.                        │
│                                                        │
│ ☑ I understand this blocks the web decoy only          │
│                                                        │
│                 [ Back ]  [ Apply block ]              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Apply stays disabled until the reason reaches 5 characters **and** the checkbox is ticked.
The checkbox is not bureaucracy — it is the scope claim, acknowledged by the operator, and
it is a good thing to point at when a judge asks about overreach.

Autofocus the reason field. During the demo this is typed under pressure.

### 13.3 Step 3 — Result

On success the modal becomes a result panel: `action_id`, `APPLIED` pill, `until`, and the
line **"Applied. Waiting for a blocked request to verify."**

It stays open and **polls `GET /api/response/actions` every 2s**. `API.md` (contract update
`cc12ddd`) marks `type: "action"` as reserved and not sent, so there is no push for this —
polling is the contract's own answer, not a workaround. When status becomes `verified`, the
pill flips to `VERIFIED` with the `verified_by_event_id` chip and a 400ms `--ok` glow. That
moment is demo step 8 — it deserves to be visible without navigating. Stop polling when the
panel closes or the action reaches a terminal status.

Then: **Undo block** (`POST /api/response/{action_id}/revoke`) and **Done**.

Undo asks for no confirmation. Making the safe, reversing action friction-free while the
dangerous action takes three steps is the right asymmetry.

### 13.4 Failure handling

Any step failing shows the API's `error.code` in mono and `error.message` as prose, keeps the
modal open, and leaves a working Back button. Never close the modal on error — mid-demo, a
vanished modal looks like a crash. Never retry apply automatically: it is a state-changing
call, and a double block is a confusing thing to explain on stage.

## 14. Fixtures and the demo-path guard

`VITE_USE_FIXTURES=1` loads `contracts/examples/events_p3.json` through a mock layer that
emulates the REST routes and replays events over a fake socket on a timer. This is how
screens 1–7 get built before M3's backend exists.

Hard requirements:

- The topbar chip reads **`FIXTURES`** in `--warn` whenever the flag is on. Loud, unmissable,
  on every screen.
- The flag defaults to **off**. The demo path must never be one stale `.env.local` away from
  showing fake data (`AGENTS.md` §9: "Fixtures only in dev mode. Nothing fake on the demo
  path.").
- `capture_mode` on fixture events is `"replay"`, so the chip would read `REPLAY` even if the
  fixture flag check were somehow bypassed. Two independent signals.

The fixture file covers: 6 `auth_failure`, 1 `auth_success`, 3 `command_input`,
1 `connection_close`, 7 `connection_open`, 3 `http_request`, 1 `synthetic_file_access`,
1 `blocked_request`. That exercises every event type and the whole demo narrative. Findings,
incidents, links and actions are **not** in the fixture file — mock those from the shapes in
`API.md` until the backend is live.

## 16. Open questions for Rohan (M3)

Ask these in the group chat early — all are small, and each one blocks a panel.

1. `GET /api/events` has no `src_ip` filter in `API.md`. Client-side filtering over the
   loaded window is fine for the lab's volumes — confirming that is not a problem.
2. **Blocking two features on the incident list.** `IncidentSummary` carries no findings and
   no link info, and `Link` has no `incident_id`, so the list cannot show rule chips or an
   "N links awaiting decision" flag without fetching every incident's detail. Could
   `IncidentSummary` carry `findings_by_rule` (same shape as the one in `/api/stats/overview`)
   and `open_link_count`? Alternatively, adding `incident_id` to `Link` would solve the
   second half on its own.
3. ~~Does `/ws/events` emit `type: "action"` for response status changes?~~ **Answered**
   by contract update `cc12ddd`: `action` is reserved and not sent. Poll
   `GET /api/response/actions` for block status. §13.3 updated to match.
4. The attack graph wants per-sensor event counts per incident. Deriving them from
   `GET /api/events?incident_id=` is fine; just confirming there is no cheaper field.
5. Is `score_breakdown` guaranteed to list every rule that fired, including uncounted ones
   with `counted: false`? §9.3 renders both, and uncounted rows are a credibility feature.
6. Does `GET /api/health` include `lab_run_id`? The topbar currently takes it from events,
   which is empty before the first event arrives.
7. Can the incident carry `score_cap` (the `cap` from `config/scoring.yaml`)? Without it the
   header shows a bare score rather than `100 / 100`, because hardcoding the denominator
   means the UI lies if the cap ever changes.
8. ~~For a rule awaiting confirmation, does its `score_breakdown` row report `points: 0`?~~
   **Answered by running the backend**: yes, `points: 0`. The modal therefore names which
   rules confirming makes count, without a delta. Leave as built.

None of these block the H4 gate. Build screen 2 on fixtures now.

## 16b. Verified against the real backend

Run on 2026-10-31 against M3's FastAPI with `backend.tools.load_fixtures`. All five built
screens render with zero console errors. What the run taught us, beyond what any amount of
fixture work would have:

**`GET /api/events` is ascending with a forward cursor.** `next_seq` is the last seq of the
page returned, not the global maximum, and a bare `limit=200` returns the *oldest* 200. The
feed used to make a single call and sort descending, which is correct only while a run fits
in one page; beyond that it would have shown the oldest events and then appended live ones
on top, leaving a silent hole. It now pages forward to the end. The fixture was returning
newest-first, which is precisely why this hid — fixtures now mirror the real ordering.

**The backend caps inside `score_breakdown`.** After confirmation the rows read R09 `5` and
R05 `0`, summing exactly to 100, each with a reason like
`first R09 (weight 15, capped at 100)`. So the raw-versus-capped footer in §9.3 stays
dormant against this backend, and the cap story is told by the backend's own reason text.
Keep the footer: it is correct either way and costs nothing.

**R05 has no finding until the link is confirmed.** Six findings before, seven after. The
page is re-fetched rather than patched, so this needs no special handling.

**Two links, not one.** The backend emits both a `strong_candidate` (honeytoken) and a
`candidate` (same src_ip within 5 min) for the same pair of decoys. This exposed a real bug
in the graph: both link labels were drawn at the same y, so the second label covered the
first link's line and made it unclickable. Lines now fan out horizontally and labels stack
vertically.

**The WebSocket sequence on a confirm is `link, finding, finding, incident`** — every one of
them carrying a repeated seq, with no new event. Confirms why the seq gate must apply to
`event` only: gating all types would have silently dropped the entire confirm flow.

**`score_breakdown` rows also carry `finding_id`**, which is not in the contract's example.
Unused so far, but it would let a breakdown row link directly to its finding card.

Not a frontend issue, worth raising with M3: the rule summary embeds
`[evidence: evt_..., evt_...]` inline in its prose, which is both hard to read and redundant
with the clickable cited-ID chips rendered beneath it.

## 17. Accessibility and demo-robustness checklist

- Severity and status never communicated by colour alone — always a word too
- All text ≥ 4.5:1 against its background; body text ≥ 7:1
- Full keyboard path through the link decision modal and the block flow
- Visible focus ring everywhere; focus trapped in modals; `Esc` closes (except mid-apply)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured for the edge-confirm animation and the row flash
- No layout shift when a long attacker string arrives — `AttackerText` is always bounded
- Every screen legible at 1280×800 and at 150% browser zoom
- Tested once against a projector before H20: dark theme gamma is the usual surprise
