# Frontend (M1)

React + TypeScript + Vite. Owner: Pashmee (M1). Design source of truth:
[`DESIGN_SPEC.md`](./DESIGN_SPEC.md).

## Run

```bash
cd dg-soc/frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Against the fixture, with no backend running — this is how to build screens
before M3 ships:

```bash
VITE_USE_FIXTURES=1 npm run dev
```

Against the live backend (M3 on `127.0.0.1:8000`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Either way the app serves on <http://127.0.0.1:5173>. The port is `strictPort`,
bound to loopback — the SOC UI is never served over the lab link
(`AGENTS.md` section 3).

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit, strict
npm run build       # typecheck + production build
```

## Fixture mode

`VITE_USE_FIXTURES=1` runs the whole UI off
`contracts/examples/events_p3.json`, imported read-only from `contracts/` so it
cannot drift from the contract. `src/api/fixtures.ts` is a mock backend: it
serves the first 13 events as the REST snapshot and streams the last 10 over a
fake socket at 1.2s intervals, so both the snapshot path and the live-append
path get exercised.

Two independent guards keep fake data off the demo path
(`AGENTS.md` section 9):

1. The flag defaults to off, and when on, the topbar shows a loud amber
   `FIXTURES` chip on every screen.
2. Fixture events carry `capture_mode: "replay"`, so the chip would read
   `REPLAY` rather than `LIVE` even if the flag check were bypassed.

With no events at all the chip reads `NO DATA`, never `LIVE`.

## Layout

```
src/
  api/        config, REST client, WebSocket with backoff, fixture backend
  components/ shell (topbar, sidebar, sensor health), connection pill,
              raw event drawer, primitives
  lib/        formatting, event glyph/colour map
  screens/    LiveFeed (built), stubs for the other six
  state/      LiveStore — snapshot + socket + pause buffer
  styles/     tokens.css (design tokens), app.css
  types/api.ts  hand-written from the contracts
  copy.ts     the AGENTS.md section 7 wording dictionary
```

## Types

`src/types/api.ts` is hand-written from `contracts/event.schema.json`,
`contracts/finding.schema.json` and `contracts/API.md`. Once M3's backend serves
`/openapi.json`, regenerate:

```bash
npx openapi-typescript http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json -o src/types/api.ts
```

These are a frozen interface (`AGENTS.md` section 3). If the backend disagrees
with this file, the contract changes by PR with Rohan's OK — we do not patch
around it in the UI.

## The three laws

1. **The browser never decides anything.** Score, severity, link status and
   whether a block worked all arrive from the API and are displayed as received.
2. **Attacker text is hostile.** It renders through `AttackerText`, which is
   escaped, mono and bounded. `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` appears nowhere.
3. **Claim only what the evidence proves.** User-facing wording comes from
   `copy.ts`, which encodes `AGENTS.md` section 7.

## What works now

- App shell: topbar (capture chip, `lab_run_id`, connection pill, UTC clock),
  sidebar nav, sensor health strip from `GET /api/health`
- Live Feed: REST snapshot then `/ws/events`, newest first, new-row flash,
  pause/resume with buffering, filters by sensor / event type / src_ip, DOM
  capped at 500 rows, every row showing its `event_id` and `incident_id`
- Raw event drawer: every schema field, attacker values in bounded wells,
  hashes truncated with copy, `Esc` to close
- Connection pill: live / reconnecting with attempt count / offline with
  last-data time and click-to-retry; exponential backoff with jitter;
  snapshot reload on every reconnect
- All six global states on the feed: loading, empty, error, filtered, capped,
  no-backend
- Incident detail: header with severity and score, kill-chain bar with a
  clickable stage filter and a real "not observed" segment, rule-based summary
  with clickable citations, finding cards showing label *and* limitation with
  every evidence id opening its raw event, score breakdown including uncounted
  rows and the cap note, cross-decoy links, sessions with replay links, and the
  response panel
- Link decision modal: both evidence events inline, mandatory rationale with a
  live character count, confirm and reject, reversible, and a reload from the
  API rather than an optimistic restyle
- Incident list: severity-bordered cards sorted by newest activity, each with
  the compact kill-chain strip, updating live from `type: "incident"` messages

## Known gaps

- Screens 1 and 5–7 are stubs that name their spec section and build order
- The incident list has no rule chips or "awaiting decision" flag:
  `IncidentSummary` carries no findings and `Link` has no `incident_id`, so
  neither has an honest source at that endpoint (open question 2)
- The incident Block button is disabled until M2's response router exists
- Export needs the live backend, so it is disabled in fixture mode
- The drawer closes on `Esc` and autofocuses, but does not fully trap focus yet
- Sensor health polls every 15s, so it can lag the feed by up to that long
- `GET /api/events` has no `src_ip` filter in the contract, so IP filtering is
  client-side over the loaded window; the UI says so above the table
- Fixture incidents carry placeholder `score: 0` / `severity: "low"` — scoring
  belongs to M3 and is never computed here
