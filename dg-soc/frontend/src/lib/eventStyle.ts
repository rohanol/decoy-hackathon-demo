/**
 * Glyph and colour per event type. DESIGN_SPEC.md section 7.2.
 *
 * Two deliberate inversions, worth being able to explain to a judge:
 *  - auth_success is red, not green. A successful login to a decoy is the bad news.
 *  - blocked_request is green. It means an analyst's block is working.
 *
 * Colour never carries the meaning on its own: every row also shows the text
 * label from copy.ts.
